// during working with number of floating point or numbers


1. showing fraction digit
suppose int i = 10;
now i have to show it as 10.000000 or setting limited fraction digit will be like 
double d = static_cast<double>(d); // static_cast is safe casting method to use changing type of related type such as int to float to double to long long..to ensure no data is lossed from main data
cout << fixed << setprecision(7) << d << endl;
// ouput == 10.0000000


2. filling zero before number
int answer = 100;
 cout << setfill('0') << setw(5) << answer << endl;
 // ouput = 00100
